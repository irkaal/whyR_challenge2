# Why R? 2020 Text Mining Hackathon Challenge 2: Segmentation

For this challenge, we used historical data of some comments from Hacker News to create meaningful segments of users.

> ## Challenge 2 - “Segmentation”
>  
> Based on historical data of some **comments** create meaningful segments of users. Can you propose any statistical measures of goodness of fit to describe the quality of the segmentation solution?
> 
> Below we present some inspirations for potential characteristics that may eventually differentiate segments:
> 
> - What is the sentiment of comments made by each group?
> - What are the common words-association within each group based on comments?
> - What are the keywords of titles of articles under which comments are made?
> - What amount of comments is done by which segment?
> - What are the characteristics of each group? 
> - What articles do they comment about and what do they write about? 
> - What is the high-level summary of groups? 
> 
> Please keep in mind a segmentation solution should have balanced segments sizes and meaningful stories behind the groups of users.

## Solution

We submitted our solution as a presentation video where we talked about each step that we took to segment the users and some insights that we discovered when exploring the data.
